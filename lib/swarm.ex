  Similar to register_name/2, except this version takes module/function/args
  parameters, and starts the process, registers the pid with the given name,
  and handles cluster topology changes by restarting the process on its new
  node using the given MFA.

  This version also returns an ok tuple with the pid if it registers successfully,
  or an error tuple if registration fails. You cannot use this with processes which
  are already started, it must be started by `:swarm`.

  A call to `Swarm.register_name/5` will return `{:error, :no_node_available}`
  when the configured distribution strategy returns `:undefined` as the node to
  host the named process. This indicates that there are too few nodes available to
  start a process. You can retry the name registration while waiting for nodes
  to join the cluster.

  Provide an optional `:timeout` value to limit the duration of register name calls.
  The default value is `:infinity` to block indefinitely.
